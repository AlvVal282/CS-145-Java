   * @see record is the method that is used to call generate pattern so that it creates a pattern for each word that is in the words TreeSet and then adds the pattern to the patternMap TreeMap as the key and the word as the value, if patternMap does not contain pattern it will then put pattern as a key and then create a TreeSet from that pattern to then store different words that have the same pattern. From their it then goes through each value for the  pattern that is stored in the patternMap to then count the occurences of the character guess or any charcters stored in guesses that may be in values of the pattern. After it has gone through each value of the pattern it compares the size of the Set of pattern in patternMap to the variable size, if it is greater than size then size will now equal the size of the Set of pattern in patternMap and it will clear what was in patternMap2 so that it can store the pattern and its values in its set. While it is still in the if statement it will also check if occurences is greater than the occurences from before, if so then the occurences from before will now store the recent occurences.Â If the size of the Set of pattern in patternMap is equal to the variable size than it will store the pattern and its values in patternMap2 and if the occurences of the letter guess is lesser than the occurences of before than the uccurences from before will now store the recent occurences. After the method has gone through each word in the words TreeSet than it will go to the next piece of code which is to add the most recent guess to the guesses TreeSet, set patternMap equal to patternMap2 since the game will now reference the words that are in patternMap2, substract 1 from guessesLeft if the count equals zero and store all values of patterMap into words.
